#Online Chat application 
This is a final project created during the Ironhack (coding boot camp) program. 
It is a prototype of what I had originally envisioned and many featurres are still missing since we had 8 days to complete it. 
This application allows Users to find a listener who would like to listen to User's problems and challenges in life.

- add an e-mail confirmation feature.
